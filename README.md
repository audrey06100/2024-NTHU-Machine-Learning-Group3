This repository contains the code and data used in our final project.

1. Time-Domain U-Net
- The code and checkpoint are stored in the Wave-U-Net/ folder.
- Based on [Wave-U-Net-for-Speech-Enhancement](https://github.com/haoxiangsnr/Wave-U-Net-for-Speech-Enhancement). Usage instructions can be found in the original repository.

2. Frequency-Domain U-Net
- The code is stored in the STFT-U-Net/ folder.

3. Data
- Pre-synthesized training and testing data can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A6QPYYVlUK5PnSQRIqm-80d9qlDLtDXV?usp=drive_link).
